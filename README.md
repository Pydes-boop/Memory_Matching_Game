# Overview

Memory Matching Game is intended for young children to learn about their favourite farm animals!

It is a *multi-sensory* learning experience that aims to improve spatial thinking skills and the motoric development of young children.

Two players play the game asymmetrically, each having different capabilities and roles within the game. One plays using Headphones and **Audio** Cues, while the other has a tablet and follows **Visual** cues:

Each Player plays with a randomized set of Memory Cards (featured with tracking Markers) and tries to match their cards with the other player. 

What follows is an interactive and fun learning experience for children integrating different stimuli!

# Game Loop
After a playing field was set up the game consists of 3 main stages:

## Lock
Here players turn around their respective game cards to choose which they want to compare and lock these choices in. The **Audio** player gets a cue on their headphones while the **Visual** Player gets to see their animal on the tablet. Neither knows about the information of the other player.

## Discuss
The players are now encouraged to discuss their respective (auditory or visual) information:

## Compare
Lastly the players push their cards together to compare if its a match or not:
